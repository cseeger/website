Five years ago I left my job to pursue the startup life and to work with Elixir full-time. I wrote about my first [two years of experience at The Outline](https://medium.com/@davelucia/two-years-of-elixir-at-the-outline-ad671a56c9ce), which was able to serve millions of users per month with a small team of developers and only ran on two Heroku dynos. The last three years, I've been at a sports technology company called [Simplebet](https://simplebet.io).
