This year, I thought it would be fun to try my hand at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I had last [participated in 2018](https://github.com/davydog187/advent_of_code_2018), but only did a few exercises. Much like 2018, I am inspired by [Jos√© Valim's live stream](https://twitter.com/josevalim/status/1466419207361466385?s=20) of AOC, which he is also doing this year. 

This year I hope to complete more than 5 of the exercises, starting with Elixir, but then I hope to go back and take a stab at implementing them in a few languages I've never used before.

## Languages

### [Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org/)

Roc is a pure, functional programming language that compiles to binary and is a direct descendent of Elm. It is still in Alpha, but the creator, [Richard Feldman](https://twitter.com/rtfeldman), was nice enough to invite me to the repo to test it out. 

### [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

Zig is a low-level, systems programming language that has a lot of interesting features. What I find particularly interesting is its ability to executue code at compile time, similar to Elixir.

### [Clojure](https://clojure.org)

Clojure is a lisp that has quite the reputation. My only dabbles with a lisp are Emacs Lisp, and I'd love to improve my lisp-foo.
## Where to follow

So far, I have completed the first day of AOC, follow along at [https://github.com/davydog187/advent_of_code_2021](https://github.com/davydog187/advent_of_code_2021)
