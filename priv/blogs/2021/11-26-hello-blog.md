Hello and welcome to my new website, [davelucia.com](https://davelucia.com)!

Throughout the last five odd years, I've been trying to get more involved in the [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) community through writing blogs, engaging on Twitter, speaking at conferences, and joining as a guest on several podcasts. This website is a way for me to aggregate all of this content, and hopefully produce more of it!

## How it's built

This website is deployed on [fly.io](https://fly.io) using a combination of [Surface](https://surface-ui.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [NimblePublisher](https://github.com/dashbitco/nimble_publisher). I designed this website myself, with some throwbacks to my time at [The Outline](https://theoutline.com/).

If you'd like to see the code, it is Open Source and available on my [Github](https://github.com/davydog187/website).

### Special Thanks
I'd also like to thank my dear friend, [Stephen Baldwin](https://www.econify.com/), who bought this domain from underneath me over 3 years ago and then proceeded to hold it hostage for 2 years. Without you, none of this would be possible.
